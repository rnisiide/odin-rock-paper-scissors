    <h1>Do you want to play a game?</h1>
    <p>This is a simple Rock, Paper and Scissors game. For now, it is still played in the Console Log:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Press F12 to open Dev Tools, and go to CONSOLE.</li>
        <li> Type in the console the function: <strong>game()</strong> </li>
        <li> A prompt will appear to choose one of the following values:
        <ul>
            <li>Rock</li>
            <li>Paper</li>
            <li>Scissors</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li> There will be 5 rounds. You can choose different values each time.</li>
        <li> The values are case iNsEnSiTivE, so you don't need to worry about CAps LoCk. However, you have to spell it properly, or it will return an INVALID OPTION.</li>
        <li> After 5 rounds the result will show in the end!! </li>
        <li> You can start a new game with the function: <strong>game()</strong></li>
    </ol>
