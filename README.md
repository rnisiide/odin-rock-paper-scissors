Now the second part of this project (revisiting) was finished.
I added buttons and images so the player can pick his choice.
In total this project took me:
-5h for the first part (all played in console.log)
-For the second part, around 2-3h to add the buttons and readjust the functions to the new score requirements 
-Around 5-6h to add all html and css elements, together with the new functions to show the player and computer choices, and to show the score
